# Gear Language
A programming language interpreter written in Free Pascal and Lazarus

The latest project can be found in folder 'compiler'. 
Both 'interpreter' and 'compiler' contain documentation about the Gear language implementation. There are differences, since the language has evolved a bit since the last 2 years.
Both projects were developed using Lazarus with Free Pascal. The latest version of them can be found at:
